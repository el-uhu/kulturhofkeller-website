Born in the wake of George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece, 1984, in the capital of the world's largest country, upon which the novel was modelled, Mary Ocher emerges as a powerhouse artist of Jewish/Ukrainian heritage. At the tender age of 4, fate brought her to Tel Aviv during the turbulent Gulf War, where she absorbed the raw currents of xenophobia and nationalism, leaving a distinct mark on her creative output – a persistent pursuit of challenging authority and deconstructing the myth of nationhood.

At the age of 20, Mary commenced a transformative odyssey in the adopted city of Berlin, a city known for its cultural crucible and its welcoming of outsiders from all walks of life.

Shortly after she embarked on a whirlwind global tour, gracing stages in 40 countries, leaving audiences spellbound with her genre-defying soundscapes. Collaborating with luminaries like H.J. Irmler of Krautrock pioneers Faust, Canadian psych-guru King Khan, avant garde-legends Die Tödliche Doris, Julia Kent and Felix Kubin, Barry Burns (Mogwai), Red Axes, composer Roberto Cacciapaglia, Chicks on Speed and more, Mary's sonic universe knows no bounds.

With a repertoire ranging from traditional folk to raw '60s garage, from ambient soundscapes with ethereal vocals to experimental pop infused with African and South American rhythms, Mary Ocher orchestrates a sonic tapestry like no other.

Over the past decade, she's unleashed five studio albums on six labels, along with a double anthology of raw home recordings, two captivating EPs, and two spellbinding collections of remixes. Each new release is a testament to her fearless exploration of musical frontiers.

But Mary Ocher is more than just a sonic explorer; she's a force of nature in a world grappling with authoritarianism, future technology, and politics. Her relentless dedication to creating passionate, uncompromising art serves as a rallying cry for those who yearn to push against the current, challenging the status quo with every note and lyric.

In the face of a global pandemic, Mary's artistic spirit remained indomitable. She was personally invited by the visionary Animal Collective to grace the stage at the esteemed Le Guess Who? Festival.
Amidst it all, she released an autobiographical comic book, a Ukraine charity EP dedicated to rebuilding shattered homes, curated a three-day festival, and compiled an album in support of girls' education in Afghanistan featuring artists Gudrun Gut, Xiu Xiu, Ana da Silva and others.

As we step into the future, Mary Ocher stands at the forefront of a sonic revolution, with three exhilarating releases poised to redefine the musical landscape in 2023-2024.

Her work remains as enchanting as it is polarizing, sparking conversations on authority, identity, and conflict. In a world yearning for change, Mary Ocher is the artist we've been waiting for – a fearless trailblazer in sound, a fierce challenger of authority, and an unapologetic visionary pushing the boundaries of music and meaning.

Mario Alexander Kuhs, a teacher, photographer, musician, and former frontman and mastermind of the Austrian
band Psycho P., is attempting a solo project after a long musical absence. Under the moniker fridolin_schneck, he
aims to rediscover the guitar for himself and find new interpretations for it.

"After playing the guitar for so long and being technically limited as a self-taught player, it's difficult to break away
from one's own path. Therefore, the fridolin_schneck project was never really intended as a solo endeavor. I always
envisioned other musicians and instruments being part of it. Music is about collaboration and dialogue. Unfortunately,
up until now, the right people haven't come together. In that sense, the solo project was born out of necessity."

Even with Psycho P., Mario Kuhs never considered himself a traditional rock guitarist, but rather a seeker who
skillfully avoided conventional riffs. The focus is on instrumental pieces, primarily featuring stripped-down clean
guitar sounds, sporadically interrupted by vocals, and enhanced with loops at the right moments. The musical project
fridolin_schneck is currently seen as a work in progress:

"I'm not entirely sure where the journey should lead. The musical foundation is there, but I'm constantly oscillating
between the different realms of experimentation and convention, between instrumental music and classic song
structures with vocal parts, micro-loops, and longer, intricate and complex pieces."

The project is currently open in all directions, potentially allowing space for other musicians and avoiding limitations.
To prevent the work from the past years spent in solitude from disappearing completely, these pieces are now being
presented as solo compositions.

The emphasis is on instrumental guitar parts, rhythmic structures, crafted and interlocking miniatures, often in
harmonic but sometimes contradictory interplay. Coming from a rock background, Mario Kuhs aims not to remain
stagnant but to constantly move forward. The pieces draw inspiration from fingerstyle guitar music, jazz, rock, pop,
metal, as well as classical singer-songwriter traditions.

"I'm not sure if it makes sense when I say I have an essayistic approach to making music. Even though there might not
be an immediate connection, when it comes to how I think and create music, I think of Robert Musil's 'The Man
Without Qualities'. I struggle to write linear songs; I'm always looking for different patterns that I can assemble like
building blocks. Perhaps it's because I'm a mathematician."

Despite all the experimentation, the music remains conventional; the guitar is plucked, struck, and caressed
extensively. Whether the project succeeds remains to be seen, as Musil's words echo: "Things might just as well be
different."
